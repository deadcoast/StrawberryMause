# Advanced Editing

## Multi-Session Workflows

- Merge multiple `.maus` files into a single timeline track or layered tracks
- Align sessions by start time or by anchor nodes

## Batch Operations

- Multi-select to move/delete groups
- Time-scale a selection (compress/expand durations)
- Normalize spacing between nodes

## Conflict Resolution

- Overlapping drags: keep longest or prefer latest edit
- Node collision: auto-offset by minimal safe delta; highlight conflicts

## Versioning Strategy

- Save versions per edit milestone; annotate with change summaries
- Use Data Integrity plan for migrations between schema versions
