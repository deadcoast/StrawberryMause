# Playback Guide

## Overview

Play back `.maus` sessions to validate timing and cursor positions at varying speeds.

## Start Playback

- Open a `.maus` file or use the current session.
- Press Play; adjust speed (0.25xâ€“4x) as needed.

## Controls

- Play / Pause / Stop
- Speed: 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x
- Jump to: previous/next node
- Loop selection (if enabled)

## Verification Tips

- Watch overlay indicators to confirm click locations.
- Compare timings against expected application responses.
- Use slow speeds to validate fine-grained sequences.

## Troubleshooting Playback

- No output: ensure permissions and that overlay is enabled.
- Timing drift: verify system load and reduce background tasks.
- Incorrect positions: recalibrate overlay or check display scaling.
